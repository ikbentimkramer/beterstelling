# beterstelling

At our small association, every member has his or her own bar tab. Usually this is not an issue, but it became one because of coronavirus measures. Instead of members coming to the bar to make orders, the bar personnel now has to go around to the seated members to take orders. This means multiple orders by multiple association members now have to be carefully recorded before being entered into the tab management system.

Enter `beterstelling`. This small `vue.js` app allows bar personnel of our small association to record multiple orders. While it does not automatically link into the tab management system, it does allow the bar personnel to review the orders so they can manually enter them into the system.

## Usage

1. Open [the app](https://ikbentimkramer.github.io/beterstelling/) on your phone
2. Enter the name of the member you are taking an order from
3. Enter the order and press the `Sla op` button at the bottom of the page
4. Review the order by pressing `Bestellingen` at the top of the page
5. When the order is recorded in the tab management system and has been served, you can press the `Verwijder` button at the bottom of the order to remove it from your review queue
